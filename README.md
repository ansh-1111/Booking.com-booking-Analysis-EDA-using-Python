# Booking.com-booking-Analysis-EDA-using-Python

In this Capstone Project on Exploratory data analysis, the prime aim has been to understand all the key concepts taught in Python modules and to use tools like Python coding, pandas libraries, and data visualization libraries to extract, analyze, and gain insight into the given hotel bookings CSV dataset from the timeline 2015-2017. 

Additionally, we have analyzed the data to understand the best time of year to book a hotel room, and the optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate. What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? 
Factors governing cancellation of bookings?

Our approach to solving these problems was as follows.

•	Loading the data from the drive into the data frame.
•	Cleaning the data frame
•	Data Analysis using Pandas library
•	Data Wrangling and Visualization

The dataset consists of 119390 rows and 32 columns.
Initially, we mounted our drive into the Collab notebook, and using the pandas library we successfully read the given CSV file. The next step was data cleaning and removing all the duplicate rows and outliers from the data. we have also handled the missing values, converted the columns to appropriate data, and added some useful columns from the data.

Thereafter, we used various data wrangling techniques and different data visualization plots to get insight into our dataset and tried to come up with useful conclusions for various exploratory data analysis problems. 

Some of our important conclusions and results from our exploratory data analysis were as follows

•	Nearly 60% of guests prefer City Hotel and only 40% of guests prefer Resort Hotel while booking.
•	Most of the customers come in August and we can see the least customers in December
•	Most bookings are done by couples. Hence providing good deals for couples can increase the number of bookings
•	 The reason behind hotel booking cancellation is due to the availability of car parking space.
•	The number of days stay preferred by the most number of customers is 1 day with nearly 25% secondly, the preferred no. of days stay is 3 days.
•	If the number of adult guests is 3 and if the number of kids is 1 or 3, then we can expect the highest number of special requests.
